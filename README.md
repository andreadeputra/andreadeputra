## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Technology fascinates me with its progress over the years. I picked up programming partially for fun, but mostly for my curiosity. And one such curiosity that sparks something in me is AI. From there, my journey in learning Data Science begins. Currently building more data science portfolios.

Tools I am familiar with:
- PgAdmin
- Git
- VSCode
- Google Looker Studio

Programming Languages I am familiar with:
- Python
- C++
- SQL
